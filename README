Xavante 2.0
http://keplerproject.org/xavante/

Xavante is a Lua HTTP 1.1 Web server that uses a modular architecture
based on URI mapped handlers. Xavante currently offers a file handler,
a redirect handler and a CGILua handler. Those are used for general files,
URI remapping and CGILua scripts respectively.

Xavante is free software and uses the same license as Lua.

Xavante includes JavaScript code under BSD license from modernmethod, inc in the sajax.lua module.

Xavante dependencies can be separated by the used handlers:


Xavante Core
        * Lua 5.1.x
        * Copas 1.1.1
        * LuaSocket 2.0.2

File Handler (optional)
        * LuaFileSystem 1.3.0

CGILua handler (optional)
        * CGILua 5.1.1
        * LuaFileSystem 1.3.0
        * Rings 1.1.0



The portability of Xavante is determined by its binary components
(LuaSocket, LuaFileSystem and Rings) and Lua itself.
The other components are written in Lua and are as portable as Lua itself.

Xavante follows the package model for Lua 5.1, therefore it should be
"installed" in your package.path.

Xavante 2.0 Beta [21/Nov/2007]

        * Xavante 2.0 Beta is distributed as a Lua module, the command line and Windows launchers are now part
        of the Kepler distribution
        * If you are using Kepler, it is strongly suggested that you replace your previous Xavante config.lua
        file with the new one installed by Kepler
        * Allow the definition of the HTTP status by using a "Status" header
        * Added the Connection: close header to every CGILua request in order to avoid confusions on the content
        size (patch by Ignacio Burgueño)
        * xavante.cgiluahandler now accepts an optional table with global names to be passed to the Ring where
        the request is processed. If this option is not present it looks for a RINGS_CGILUA_GLOBALS global and uses it.
        * Fixed bug [#1812] - SAPI.Response.Write was not sending all its arguments but the first one
        (bug found by Ignacio Burgueño)
