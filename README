Xavante 1.3
http://keplerproject.org/xavante/

Xavante is a Lua HTTP 1.1 Web server that uses a modular architecture
based on URI mapped handlers. Xavante currently offers a file handler,
a redirect handler and a CGILua handler. Those are used for general files,
URI remapping and CGILua scripts respectively.

Xavante is free software and uses the same license as Lua. 

Xavante dependencies can be separated by the used handlers:

Xavante Core
* Lua 5.1.x
* Copas 1.1.1
* LuaSocket 2.0.1

File Handler (optional)
* LuaFileSystem 1.2.1

CGILua handler (optional)
* CGILua 5.1
* LuaFileSystem 1.2.1
* Rings 1.1.0

The portability of Xavante is determined by its binary components
(LuaSocket, LuaFileSystem and Rings) and Lua itself.
The other components are written in Lua and are as portable as Lua itself.

Xavante follows the package model for Lua 5.1, therefore it should be
"installed" in your package.path.

History

Xavante 1.3 [24/Aug/2007]
* Uses Lua 5.1
* Fixed headers to send the header twice if it's defined twice,
  instead of concat'ing with commas (previous behavior was broken
  when sending cookies)
* Removed the restriction of only handling URLs that corresponded
  to files in the filesystem. Now cgilua.dispatcher can map URLs
  like /apps/wiki/... into whatever it needs. Patch by Mauricio Bomfim.
* Corrected the PATH_INFO handling for cgilua.dispatcher
* Code refactoring by Thomas Harning (Bug [#767])
* Better error handling, using io.stderr instead of print
* Added the correct prefix to error codes (by Zachary P. Landau)
* Support for caching based on last-modified implemented by Zachary P. Landau, based on the desing of HTTP.lua (by PA)
* Content Encoding handling using encoding.lua as a configuration file, added svgz encoding and content-type
* Fixed bug [#510] filehandler does not send correct headers for 404 error (found by Matthew Burke)
